Subject:  Productionalize one of your other projects. 

Tasks:
Task 1: Review the Notebook

   The Jupyter Notebook that I have previously created is located within test_psuh.py; its task is to load the iris data set, apply noise to some columns, and observe how the noise impacts a logistic regression model.

Task 2: Structure Your Script

    A new Python file notebook.py is the driver script for a collection of python files which include: data loading, prompt a user of a type of noise to apply to iris and which columns to add the noise too.

Task 3: Clean up your python code

    Each .py file should is documented with docstrings and comments.  

Task 4: Testing

    If you git pull this repo the scripts should run without errors assuming the requirements.txt file is adheared too.  

Task 5: Documentation and Comments

    Comments have been added throughout scripts to explain non-obvious parts of the code.
