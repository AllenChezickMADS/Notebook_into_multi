Subject:  Productionalize one of your other projects. 

Tasks:
Task 1: Review the Notebook

    Choose a Jupyter Notebook that you have previously created, which contains a data analysis or data processing task. This notebook should include data loading, data cleaning, 

    Your notebook should do the following, read data in from someplace.  Modify/clean the data, then do a task with the data (build a model, output a graph etc) 

Task 2: Structure Your Script

    Create a new Python (.py) file.  Depending on your imports you may need more than one

    Identify logical sections in your notebook (e.g., data loading, cleaning, analysis, visualization, etc.).

    For each section, determine the functions that you can create. Each function should have a single responsibility and a clear input/output interface.

    Do NOT hard code anything like paths or assumptions.   We should be able to reuse your python file with different inputs and save output in different places. 

Task 3: Clean up your python code

    Your file should be well documented with docstrings and comments.  

    You should be using typehints. 

    Make sure you pass a pylinter without errors

Task 4: Testing

    Test your script in a new environment to make sure it runs without errors.  

    Bonus points if you create real unit tests.

Task 5: Documentation and Comments

    Add comments throughout your script to explain non-obvious parts of the code.

    Write a README file that includes:

        An introduction to the script.

        Instructions on how to set up the environment to run the script (e.g., required packages, data files)

        A description of the script's functionality.

You should submit your work via github.  You should have at least a few different commits.  

Evaluation Criteria:

Functionality: The script runs without errors and produces the correct output.

Modularity: The code is organized into functions and potentially classes with single responsibilities.

Readability: The code includes comments and docstrings for functions. Proper naming conventions are followed.

Documentation: The README is well-written and provides all necessary information to run the script.

Best Practices: The code follows Python best practices, including PEP 8 style guidelines.
